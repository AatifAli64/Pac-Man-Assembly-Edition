# Pac-Man-Assembly-Edition
A Pac-Man game written in x86 assembly language using only the Irvine32 library. This project features real AI movement for ghosts, smooth player controls, and proper collision detection. The game logic is implemented at a low level, handling graphics, input, and movement without high-level abstractions.
